## Features

### 1. Hero Text
- "Happy Rose Day" displayed in a beautiful cursive font (Dancing Script from Google Fonts) centered at the top
- Soft, elegant styling with a subtle text shadow for a dreamy effect

### 2. Rose Bloom on Click/Tap
- Clicking or tapping anywhere on the screen spawns a rose at that position
- The rose starts as a tiny bud and gracefully scales up with smooth easing
- Each rose is built with multiple layered petal elements (CSS-based overlapping shapes) to create a realistic rose silhouette
- Random soft color per rose: soft pink, peach, cream, pale yellow, lavender
- Subtle opacity and blur transitions for a delicate, airy feel
- Roses persist for a few seconds then gracefully fade out

### 3. Floating Petal Particles
- When a rose blooms, small petal-like particles drift away from it
- Particles float in random directions with gentle rotation and fade out
- Adds a cherry blossom / ethereal quality to the interaction

### 4. Background
- Elegant gradient background (dark charcoal to deep purple/navy) to make the light-colored roses pop beautifully

### 5. Responsiveness
- Works seamlessly on desktop (mouse clicks) and mobile (touch/taps)
- Full-screen experience with no scrolling needed
